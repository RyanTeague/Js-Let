    <!--JavaScript Let
    
        The let keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015)

        Variables declared with let have Block Scope

        Variables declared with let must be Declared before use

        Variables declared with let cannot be Redeclared in the same scope
    -->

    <!--Block Scope
    
       Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript did not have Block Scope.

        JavaScript had Global Scope and Function Scope.

        ES6 introduced the two new JavaScript keywords: let and const.

        These two keywords provided Block Scope in JavaScript:

        Example
        Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block: 

        {
            let x = 2;
        }
        // x can NOT be used here
    -->



    <!--Global Scope
    
        Variables declared with the var always have Global Scope.

        Variables declared with the var keyword can NOT have block scope:

        Example
        Variables declared with varinside a { } block can be accessed from outside the block:

        {
            var x = 2;
        }
        // x CAN be used here
    -->

    <!--Cannot be Redeclared
        Variables defined with let can not be redeclared.

        You can not accidentally redeclare a variable declared with let.

        With let you can not do this:

        let x = "John Doe";

        let x = 0;
        Variables defined with var can be redeclared.

        With var you can do this:

        var x = "John Doe";

        var x = 0;
    -->

<!--Redeclaring Variables

    Redeclaring a variable using the var keyword can impose problems.

    Redeclaring a variable inside a block will also redeclare the variable outside the block:
-->
    <h2>Redeclaring a Variable Using var</h2>

    <p id="demo"></p>

    <script>
    var  x = 10;
    // Here x is 10

    {  
    var x = 2;
    // Here x is 2
    }

    // Here x is 2
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
    </script>

    <hr>

<!--Redeclaring a variable using the let keyword can solve this problem.

Redeclaring a variable inside a block will not redeclare the variable outside the block:
-->
<h2>Redeclaring a Variable Using let</h2>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
let  x = 10;
// Here x is 10

{  
  let x = 2;
  // Here x is 2
}

// Here x is 10
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
</script>

<hr>

<!--Difference Between var, let and const
Scope	Redeclare	Reassign	Hoisted	Binds this
var	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes
let	Yes	No	Yes	No	No
const	Yes	No	No	No	No
What is Good?
let and const have block scope.

let and const can not be redeclared.

let and const must be declared before use.

let and const does not bind to this.

let and const are not hoisted.

What is Not Good?
var does not have to be declared.

var is hoisted.

var binds to this.

Browser Support
The let and const keywords are not supported in Internet Explorer 11 or earlier.

The following table defines the first browser versions with full support:-->

<!--Redeclaring

    Redeclaring a JavaScript variable with var is allowed anywhere in a program:
-->
<h2>JavaScript let</h2>

<p>Redeclaring a JavaScript variable with <b>var</b> is allowed anywhere in a program:</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
var x = 2;
// Now x is 2

var x = 3;
// Now x is 3

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
</script>

<hr>
<!--With let, redeclaring a caribale in the same block is NOT allowed:-->
<h2>JavaScript let</h2>

<p>Redeclaring a variable with <b>let</b>, in another scope, or in another block, is allowed:</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
let x = 2;   // Allowed

{
  let x = 3;   // Allowed
}

{
  let x = 4;   // Allowed
}
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
</script>

<!--Let Hoisting

    Variables defined with var are hoisted to the top and can be initialized at any time.

Meaning: You can use the variable before it is declared:
-->
<h2>JavaScript Hoisting</h2>

<p>With <b>var</b>, you can use a variable before it is declared:</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
carName = "Volvo";
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = carName;
var carName;
</script>

<!--Variables defined with let are also hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialized.

Meaning: Using a let variable before it is declared will result in a ReferenceError:
-->

<h2>JavaScript Hoisting</h2>
<p>With <b>let</b>, you cannot use a variable before it is declared.</p>
<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
try {
  carName = "Saab";
  let carName = "Volvo";
}
catch(err) {
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = err;
}
</script>
